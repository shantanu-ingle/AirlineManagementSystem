Creating a README for your GitHub repository is a great way to document your Airline Management System project, explain its purpose, and provide instructions for others to use or contribute to it. Below is a well-structured README template tailored to your Spring Boot application. You can copy this into a file named README.md in your repositoryâ€™s root directory.

Airline Management System
Overview
The Airline Management System is a RESTful API built with Spring Boot that allows users to manage flight schedules and tickets. It provides endpoints to retrieve flight information, book tickets, view ticket details, and cancel bookings, with validations to ensure data integrity. This project serves as a backend service for an airline management application, ideal for educational purposes or as a foundation for a real-world system.

Features
Flight Management:
Retrieve all flights with optional sorting by flight number (GET /api/flights?sort=asc).
Get details of a specific flight (GET /api/flights/{id}).
Fetch schedules for a flight, filtered by date (GET /api/flights/{id}/schedules?dates=).
Ticket Management:
Book a ticket for a flight schedule (POST /api/tickets).
Retrieve ticket details (GET /api/tickets/{id}).
Cancel a ticket (DELETE /api/tickets/{id}).
Validations:
Prevents booking when no seats are available.
Ensures valid email format for passengers.
Blocks duplicate ticket cancellations.

cd airline-management-system

Build the Project:
bash
mvn clean install

Run the Application:
bash
mvn spring-boot:run
The app will start on http://localhost:8080.
Initial Setup
Since this uses an H2 in-memory database, you need to populate initial data:

Open the H2 console at http://localhost:8080/h2-console.
Log in with:
JDBC URL: jdbc:h2:mem:airline_db
Username: sa
Password: (leave blank)

Run this SQL to add sample data:
sql
INSERT INTO FLIGHT (FLIGHT_NUMBER, ORIGIN, DESTINATION) 
VALUES ('AA101', 'New York', 'Los Angeles');

INSERT INTO SCHEDULE (FLIGHT_ID, DEPARTURE_TIME, ARRIVAL_TIME, AVAILABLE_SEATS, PRICE) 
VALUES (1, '2025-03-18 10:00:00', '2025-03-18 13:00:00', 50, 199.99);
